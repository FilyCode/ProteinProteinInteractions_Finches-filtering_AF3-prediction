# Note: The FINCHES package itself (idptools/finches) is intentionally
# NOT included directly in this YML file as a pip dependency.
# This is because the FINCHES documentation recommends installing it
# via 'git clone' followed by 'pip install -e .' for better
# updates and Cython compilation.
#
# To fully reproduce the environment:
# 1. Create the environment using this YML:
#    conda env create -f finches_env.yml
# 2. Activate the environment:
#    conda activate finches-env
# 3. Clone the FINCHES repository:
#    git clone https://github.com/idptools/finches.git
# 4. Navigate into the cloned 'finches' directory:
#    cd finches
# 5. Install FINCHES in editable mode:
#    pip install -e .
#
# If Finches is updated can easily included that into environment with:
# conda activate finches-env
# cd <directory>/finches_tools/finches 
# git pull
